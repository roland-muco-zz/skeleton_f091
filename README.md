# skeleton_f091

Skeleton application for `STMF091xx` including the bare minimum to get started. Using the `NUCLEO-F091RC` as a starting point, this skeleton helps to get things underway a.s.a.p.

The project can be imported in `STM32CubeIDE`.

The `bsp.*` holds a set of functions enabling the use of `printf` and `scanf`. Also in the `bsp` the usual `LED` and some effort to use the hardware `CRC` generator of the `STM32`'s.

Things to add:

- ASSERT
- DEBUG_PRINT

Have fun.
