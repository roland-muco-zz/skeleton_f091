# skeleton_f091

Skeleton application for STMF091xx including the bare minimum tp get started. Using the NUCLEO-F091RC as a starting point, this skeleton helps to get things underway a.s.a.p.

The bsp.* holds some functions to be able to use `printf` and `scanf` so `stdio.*` can be used. Also in the bsp the usual LED and some effort to use the hardware CRC generator of the STM32's.

Things to add:

  ASSERT
  DEBUG_PRINT

Have fun.
